I am a  final year student in the Ph.D. program at the College of Information and Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
I work under the guidance of Professor [Rod Grupen](http://www-robotics.cs.umass.edu/~grupen/) at the [Laboratory of Perceptual Robotics](https://www-robotics.cs.umass.edu/).  My research focuses on long-term autonomy and decision-making under partial observability for robotic systems. I develop active exploration methods to make robots efficiently learn predictive models from experience, prioritizing sample efficiency, task-relevant saliency, and broad coverage of initially unknown state spaces. 

I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology from [K. J. Somaiya College of Engineering](https://www.somaiya.edu/kjsce) in 2016 and proceeded to work as a Software Developer at [Aitoe Labs](http://www.aitoelabs.com/) developing video analytics softwares for online surveillance, search and summarization. 
While pursuing my undergraduate degree, I had the opportunity to work on a few extremely interesting projects including [Square Off](http://squareoffnow.com/) and [Team Eta](http://www.teameta.in/).
